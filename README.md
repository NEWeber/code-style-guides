## FAQs

### Why? Isn't code formatting up to personal preference?

Consistent code formatting increases readability, and reduces the overhead of understanding each other's code. A coder should be able to pick up any arbitrary file, and understand it quickly. Ideally, our codebase should look as though it were written by a single coder. You are not coding for yourself; you are coding for REI.

### How do I propose a change?

A developer who would like to propose a change to a code style guide must:

1. Create a PR with the proposed changes, documenting the why and what.
1. Email the team with the update.
1. Any pro's and con's or alternatives can be discussed in the PR until the review date.
    - If needed, modify your PR per team recommendations and notify team of updatesÂ 
1. Merge the PR after:
    - You wait for the next code style review date
    - A minimum of 2/3 of team indicate approval<sup>1</sup>, at least one of whom must be a senior<sup>2</sup>, and
    - At least 1 week's time has passed from request-vote email<sup>3</sup>.

<sup>1</sup>Abstains will not be included in the vote approval calculation.<br>
<sup>2</sup>Due to the team-wide impact<br>
<sup>3</sup>To give everyone a chance to review<br>

### When will my change be reviewed and merged?

The point of a code style guide is to the save time, effort, and annoyance of discussing tabs vs spaces. Doing so will allow developers to focus on getting work done. With style guides you have to just 'pick something' and stick with it.

We have decided to pick something and stick with it... for a long while. We can't say that we will never want to switch to a completely different style guide or make a couple of small changes but the compromise is to limit changes by reviewing the styleguide every `X` months/year(s).

Any suggestions in the issue queue will be up for careful consideration at the time for review.

### What about code with old formatting?

There's no need to make a specific effort to re-format old code, but if you're modifying a file with outdated formatting, please update what you can while you're in there.

### Editor Configuration

Set up your editor to automatically format code per our style guide:

- **Intellij**
  - Import [settings](./rei_standard_intellij_settings.jar).
  - In Settings, select Editor->Code Style and select "REI IT" scheme from the drop-down menu.
  - To format code, select Code->Reformat Code.

- **Sublime Text**
  - Install [JS Beautify](https://github.com/enginespot/js-beautify-sublime).
  - Update settings using [this config](./.jsbeautifyrc).
  - Code is formatted automatically on save by default. You can turn this off in the .jsbeautifyrc file and format on demand using CNTL-OPTION-F (mac) CNTL-ALT-F (win).
