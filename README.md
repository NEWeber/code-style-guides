## FAQs

### Why? Isn't code formatting up to personal preference?

Consistent code formatting increases readability, and reduces the overhead of understanding another's (and your own old) code. A coder should be able to pick up any arbitrary file, and understand it quickly. Ideally, our codebase should look as though it were written by a single coder. You are not coding for yourself; you are coding for REI.

### How do I propose a change?

A developer whom would like to propose a change to a code style guide must:

1. Create a PR with the proposed changes
1. Email the team requesting review, including a link to the PR
1. Merge the PR after:
    - A minimum of two team members indicate approval, at least one of whom must be a senior<sup>1</sup>, and
    - At least 24 hours have passed since the review-request email was sent<sup>2</sup>
1. Email the team with the update

<sup>1</sup>Due to the team-wide impact<br>
<sup>2</sup>To give everyone a chance to review if they want

### What about code with old formatting?

There's no need to make a specific effort to re-format old code, but if you're modifying a file with outdated formatting, please update what you can while you're in there.
