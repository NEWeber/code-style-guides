## FAQs

### Why? Isn't code formatting up to personal preference?

Consistent code formatting increases readability, and reduces the overhead of understanding another's (and your own old) code. A coder should be able to pick up any arbitrary file, and understand it quickly. Ideally, our codebase should look as though it were written by a single coder. You are not coding for yourself; you are coding for REI.

### How do I propose a change?

A developer whom would like to propose a change to a code style guide must:

1. Create a PR with the proposed changes.
1. Email the team requesting review, including a link to the PR.
1. Present your suggested update at the next team meeting for an open discussion.
1. If needed, modify your PR per team recommendations and notify team of updates.
1. Open a vote for 1 week.
1. Merge the PR after:
    - A minimum of 3/4 of team indicate approval, at least one of whom must be a senior<sup>1</sup>, and
    - At least 1 week from initial presentation has passed to give everyone a chance to review
1. Email the team with the update.

### What about code with old formatting?

There's no need to make a specific effort to re-format old code, but if you're modifying a file with outdated formatting, please update what you can while you're in there.
